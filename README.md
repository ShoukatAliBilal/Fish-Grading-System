The project focuses on developing a robust and efficient fish detection and measurement system utilizing Mask R-CNN, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture. Designed to perform instance segmentation and real-world dimension estimation, the system accurately detects fish in images and video frames while measuring their width and length using pixel-to-centimeter conversion. By leveraging advanced features like RoI Align and a dedicated mask head, the model achieves high accuracy (mAP: 85%, IoU: 80%) and precise segmentation. The project addresses challenges such as varying orientations, occlusions, and environmental conditions, making it highly adaptable for applications in aquaculture, marine biology, and ecological research. With further optimization, the system holds potential for real-time monitoring, behavioral analysis, and integration with IoT and edge devices, ensuring scalability and versatility.
